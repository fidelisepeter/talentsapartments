OTHER OBSERVATIONS
<!-- -	Rooms Available: On the Dashboard the figure should show a different total from the Room. Room should show the Total number of the TYPES OF ROOMS we have, while ROOM AVAILABLE show be the total number of all rooms available regardless of type.  -->
<!-- -	Approval of Rooms: This should not be possible if a prove of payment has not been submitted.
-	Guarantor Form: There should be a means to upload Guarantor’s form on the student’s page just like as Proof of Payment can be uploaded. -->
